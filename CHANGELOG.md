# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## 1.3.0 - Music Mode and Metadata
Added:
- Music mode (opt-in per playlist and per single-URL run) with audio-focused metadata and music-safe naming.
- yt-dlp cookies support (Netscape cookies.txt) for improved YouTube Music metadata.
- Music filename template support (artist/album/track hierarchy).
- Music metadata enrichment pipeline (MusicBrainz + optional AcoustID + artwork) with background tagging.
- UI controls for music mode, cookies, music template, and metadata enrichment options.
- Config UI controls for watcher enable, backoff timing, and downtime window.
- Per-playlist subscribe mode (only download new videos after first run).
- Single-playlist run controls in the Web UI.
- Single-URL delivery modes (server library or one-time client download via HTTP).
- Button to Kill downloads in progress (cancel active run from Status Section).
- Adaptive watcher with per-playlist state persisted in SQLite.
- Watch policy config with downtime windows and backoff timing.

Changed:
- Metadata flow now prefers yt-dlp music fields when music mode is enabled.
- Music metadata tagging can overwrite existing yt-dlp tags by default (configurable).
- Music URLs (music.youtube.com) auto-enable music mode for single URL runs.
- Music mode download URLs use music.youtube.com when enabled.
- Music mode respects video formats (does not force audio when final_format is a video).
- Download execution uses a native single-call path with explicit JS runtime/solver and a muxed-video requirement, with hardened fallback on failure.
- Watcher uses a single supervisor loop and deterministic scheduling.
- Downloads respect downtime windows and defer until downtime ends.
- Watcher batches detections with a quiet-window strategy and sends one Telegram summary per batch.
- Status now reports current phase and last error for active runs.

## 1.2.0 - OAuth Web UI Helper
Added:
- Web UI OAuth helper per account (launches Google auth URL + paste code to save token).
- API endpoints to support OAuth in the Web UI flow.

  - `image: ghcr.io/z3ro-2/youtube-archiver:latest`

## 1.1.2 - Publish Docker to GHCR Latest
No changes from v1.1.1 - just creating new tag to automatically publish to GHCR repo to make docker pulls directly from there.

Docker Compose Line:
image: ghcr.io/z3ro-2/youtube-archiver:latest

## 1.1.1 - Minor Patch
